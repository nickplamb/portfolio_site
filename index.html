        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <p>My name is Nicholas Lamb.
          <br>I am a <span>&lt;web&gt;</span> developer from The United States
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/nickplamb">Check out some of my code</a></p>

      <h2>A Little About Me.</h2>
      <p class="about-me__item">
        I am an aspiring software developer. I have always been interested in code but life has taken me away from that path until now. I have decided
        to turn my hobby and passion into a career so I can continue to support my wonderful wife and our son Oren. I have two very annoying cats who
        I love dearly and 3 chickens who very graciously give us eggs to eat.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me__item">
        We move out of San Francisco in 2017 so we could fulfill my wifes life long dream of hiking the Appalachian Trail. After 7 months of hiking
        and a cross country road trip to visit friends and family we landed here in Columbus to begin the next leg of our journey.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me__item">
        I enjoy wood working, tinkering, learning about gardening(the actual gardening is not going very well), and learning in general. I
        have created a couple of Arduino projects including a <a href="https://github.com/nickplamb/Coop_logger">temperature and humidity logger</a>
        for my chicken coop and a Minute To Win It style <a href="https://github.com/nickplamb/MTWI_nano">countdown timer</a> with LCD screen and
        buzzer.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me__item">
        I hope to create many more projects in the future such as a network of temperature sensors around my house, some house plant soil moisture
        sensors, and a thumb print scanner to open our garage and log entry. I want to continue learning Python and create some of these projects
        using CircuitPython. I hope to some day have a 3D printer and/or a laser cutter that my wife and I can use to make all kinds of cool things
        and
        maybe make a side business out of it. I also hope to get back into brewing beer and maybe making some hard cider too.

          <h3>Chicken Coop Data Logger</h3>
          <p>An Arduino project to log the temperature and humidity inside and outside my chicken coop. It is solar powered and POSTs the data to a
            simple PHP script and MySQL database on a home server. The script will also send the data to Thingspeak and can be configured to send me a
            text message if the door to the coop is unlocked at a specified time.</p>
          <p>I designed, assembled, and soldered the circuits together myself. Power managment and requirments were my biggest hurdle for this
            project.
            I did not have a multimeter sensitive enough to read the current draw well enough so I had to use a bunch of math and guesstimates to make
            sure I had enough power for this to run indefinitely.</p>
          <p>Tech used: PHP, C++/Arduino, MySQL, ESP8266, DHT22 sensors, solar charging system, various electronic parts.</p>
