          category, difficulty, type, and number of questions they would like to answer. I would like to add a DB to this App to allow users to login
          and keep track of their scores and host a scoreboard of all users.</p>
        <p>In building this app I learned DOM manipulation, IIFEs, promises, AJAX, polyfills, CSS animations, modals, and Bootstrap.</p>

          Create React App and has a 100% testing coverage with unit, integration, acceptance, and end-to-end tests. Jest is used as a testing
          framework with Enzyme, Cucumber, and Puppeteer integrations. Serverless functions hosted on AWS Lambda are used for authenticating the users
          Google account.</p>
        <p>In building this app I learned about serverless functions, OAuth, CRA, TDD and BDD, Gherkin, PWAs, OOP class inheritance, and performance
          monitoring.</p>

      <!-- coop data logger-->
      <div class="grid__item">
        <h3>Chicken Coop Data Logger</h3>
        <p>An Arduino project to log the temperature and humidity inside and outside my chicken coop. It is solar powered and POSTs the data to a
          simple PHP script and MySQL database on a home server. The script will also send the data to Thingspeak and can be configured to send me a
          text message if the door to the coop is unlocked at a specified time.</p>
        <p>I designed, assembled, and soldered the circuits together myself. Power managment and requirments were my biggest hurdle for this project.
          I did not have a multimeter sensitive enough to read the current draw well enough so I had to use a bunch of math and guesstimates to make
          sure I had enough power for this to run indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Tech used: PHP, C++/Arduino, MySQL, ESP8266, DHT22 sensors, solar charging system, various electronic parts.</p>
