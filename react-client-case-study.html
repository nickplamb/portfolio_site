        <h1>Case Study for Chicken Picker React Client</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Chicken Picker is a React Client designed for use with my Chicken Picker API. This MERN stack, Single Page Application allows users to view
          detailed information about different chicken breeds, view more information about their classifications and general utility. Users can also
          save breeds as their favorites and edit their profile information.
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose and Context</h3>
        <p>
          Chicken Picker was a project built for the CareerFoundry Full-Stack Immersion course. This project was used to learn and develop my
          front-end
          knowledge in order to expand my skills into a true full-stack skill set.
        </p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
          The true goal of this project was to master React, Redux, Parcel, and Axios. These tools and their underlying concepts (components,
          lifecycle, state, props, API access, transpiling, etc.) will be essential in my future full-stack career. I decided to take the option of
          straying from the course's original project content, a movie information app, and chose something that could still satisfy the underlying
          structure of the movie app. This structure boiled down to a list of items that had at least two properties that could be shared with other
          items in the list. Instead of Director and Genre properties, my app has industry classification and general breed utility. This way I could
          follow along with the course and complete the rubric requirements for each task but still end up with something unique, a little quirky, and
          personal. Most websites and resources about chicken breeds are either a little dated, not all that comprehensive, or are part of a sales
          catalog from a hatchery. Because of this the backyard chicken community is in need of a modern and comprehensive resource for viewing and
          ultimately selecting which breeds they would like to include in their flock. I would have liked to have had access to such a resource in my
          search for a backyard flock.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Initial views</h3>
        <p>I had to start somewhere working with React for the first time, so I started with some hard coded data and began building out my initial
          components. This got me accustomed to working in components, how they nest, and their basic lifecycle methods. I was able to loop through an
          array of items and display a separate card for each item. I later refactored this functionality into a separate component that I could reuse
          on the profile page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I had somewhere to display data I began using Axios to request data from my API. In order to retrieve data from
          the API a user must login, so I built out a login form. The validation for this was very tricky and I am proud of how it turned out. I used
          the basic structure found in a tutorial provided as a resource but had to heavily customize it for my use. I used the same structure to
          validate the user registration form and later for the profile update form. I toyed with the idea of making the validation a reusable
          component that I could use for all three forms but in the end I decided that the requirements for each were different enough that it was
          simpler, and therefore quicker and less prone to bugs, if I recreated it for each form. I did, however, create a simple component used with
          each input on all three forms to display the validation messages to the user.
        </p>
        <h3>Navbar and routing</h3>
        <p>
          Now that I had the ability to login, request data from the API, and display that data I decided it was time to start structuring the routing
          of my app before I had too many views. Routing involves displaying a different page to the user depending on the links they press or the URL
          they type into the address bar. In a Single Page Application such as this there is really only one page but different views are displayed on
          it based on the logic put into the app. In order to do the routing I used the React-Router library which allowed me to easily define the
          routes I wanted and I could also add safeguards to keep users who are not logged in from viewing pages they are not supposed to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only are these protected routes important to keep mischievous users away but it also makes the user experience better by ensuring that a
          user does not accidentally navigate to a page that requires a logged in user to fetch data from the API and the page bugging out. With
          routing added in, the user needed a way to navigate around other than typing in urls so I built out a navigation bar for the top of each
          page. For this and other styling I used the React-Bootstrap library.
        </p>
        <h3>Detail views</h3>
        <p>
          With the basic structure of the app in place I could start to build out some of the other views. The breed details, breed purpose, breed
          class, and user profile views were fairly straightforward to build but I did run into a few snags involving my API's data. For example,
          there are many breeds that are great at laying eggs and that can also be raised for their meat. These breeds are commonly called
          dual-purpose breeds. Unfortunately, the data I had listed these breeds as being for eggs and meat separately. I had to create some logic
          that would correct this in order to easily display all similar breeds in the purpose view. Another tricky bit that was a lot of fun to
          figure out was how to implement a way for users to add and remove a breed to their favorites list and then display this list on their
          profile page. I went through a couple of ways to make this work but I couldn't find a way to make it work without doing what is known as
          prop drilling. This is where a piece of data is passed from one component to a nested component and then onto another nested component, etc.
          until it reaches the component that needs it. It wasn't until the next step where I implemented Redux to store data that I found a way to
          make the favorites toggle work the way I wanted it to.
        </p>
        <h3>Redux</h3>
        <p>
          Before using Redux I was a little worried about the complexity of Redux because of the way it is often talked about but I found it to be
          relatively easy to understand and implement. Redux is a library that allows an app to have what is known as a global state, that is data
          that is accessible to any part of the app that needs it. I actually really enjoyed using it because it allowed me to remove a ton of clutter
          from my code and ultimately made it cleaner and more readable. The most complicated part of it is the behind the scenes magic that happens
          with the mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps functions used with the connect function. These are just completely opaque functions but
          once I did some research and understood what was happening they were very easy to work with.
        </p>
        <h3>Filter and sort</h3>
        <p>
          The last main features to be added were the filter and sort functionality on the main view and profile page. I added these features to the
          multi breed view I mentioned earlier and Redux really made these easy to work with. The filter functionality was not hard to implement but
          the sorting was a little trickier. This was another feature that I really enjoyed implementing because it required a lot of researching,
          thought, and trial and error to get just right. This is a small example of one of the most fun things about programming and was very
          exciting when I finished it.

        <h3>Future Development</h3>
        <p>
          One of the biggest pain points for this project was something that was, in part, self imposed and that was working with certain aspects of
          my
          API. The main issues I faced was that the data I collected is not very clean. This was somewhat by design because I have intentions of
          expanding the app to allow users to submit their own data about chicken breeds which would be held for review before being published. This
          would allow me to crowd source more thorough data about even more chicken breeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also wanted to make sure that each user was unique and the way I did that was to make the users email unique and unchangeable. I don't
          think
          this worked out well in the end. I need to do some more research to see what is the best practice for keeping unique users.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is my understanding that for an app this size Redux might be a little bit overkill for state management. I think moving forward I will
          look
          further into React's Context API which allows data to be freely available to a component and any of its descendants. This might end up being
          all I need for the app as it is but I will need to evaluate any further features I'd like to implement before taking such a drastic step.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last thing I want to improve is the general UI/UX of the app. I would like to work with a designer to help implement a more cohesive and
          appealing user experience that would help bring the app out of the realm of the learning and hobby project to being a useful real world app.
        </p>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          I really enjoyed working with React and found the flexibility of the component structure fun and challenging to work with. The puzzle
          involved with trying to hold nested components, their props, and functionality in my mind was the kind of challenge that I enjoy and can
          really dig my teeth into. I think this app turned out really well and I am very happy with the functionality. Building this app layed a
          solid
          foundation for my React skills and advanced my understanding of JavaScript.
